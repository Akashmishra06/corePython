### ðŸ§  **Recommended Practice Projects**:

#### 1. **To-Do List Manager (With File Save)**
- Add, delete, and view tasks.
- Save/load tasks from a text file.

#### 2. **Student Grade Tracker**
- Use dictionaries to store students and their scores.
- Add calculation of average, max score, etc.

#### 3. **Expense Tracker**
- Let the user input expenses.
- Group by category and store in a file or dictionary.

#### 4. **Quiz App**
- Create a list/dictionary of questions and answers.
- Score the userâ€™s answers and give feedback.

#### 5. **Simple Banking System**
- Simulate account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balances using classes (OOP).

#### 6. **Library Management System**
- Use classes and dictionaries.
- Include book records, borrowing system, and admin features.

#### 7. **Basic Data Analysis (CSV)**
- Load and analyze a CSV using `pandas`.
- Calculate averages, sort data, filter based on conditions.

#### 8. **Web Scraper**
- Use `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` to extract headlines from a news website.

#### 9. **Mini Game (Tic Tac Toe / Rock Paper Scissors)**
- Implement basic logic, win/lose conditions, and loop until game over.

#### 10. **Weather App (API Integration)**
- Use the OpenWeather API to fetch and display real-time weather for a city.

### ðŸ“˜ **Bonus Concepts to Start Learning**:
- `try` / `except` blocks (Exception Handling)
- `with open()` for file I/O
- `class` and `__init__()` for creating objects
- List Comprehensions
- Using `pip` to install external packages (like `pandas`, `requests`, etc.)

---

### ðŸŒ± How to Keep Growing:
- Start a **GitHub repo** and upload your projects.
- Pick a small **capstone project** (e.g., To-do app with GUI or CSV backend).
- Explore **Jupyter Notebooks** for data work.
- Try solving challenges on platforms like **HackerRank**, **LeetCode**, or **Replit**.

Would you like me to prepare a custom **checklist with milestones**, or focus on a specific project first like the To-Do list or a data-based one?
